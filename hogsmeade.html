	<p id="txtmm">Hogsmeade, was the only all-wizarding village in Britain. It was founded by Hengist of Woodcroft. Since before 1714 (when the 1714 Edict was passed), Hogwarts third-years and above had been permitted weekend trips into the village.Mainly, students frequented the High Street in the village, which contained the named speciality shops and pubs such as Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes. Hogsmeade was a picturesque little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging in the trees during the holidays. It was also near the location of the train station used by the Hogwarts Express.</p>
