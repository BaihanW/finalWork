		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw.Members of this house were characterised by their<span>wit, learning, and wisdom.</span>The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours.The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady,real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are red and gold. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the house ghost. Ravenclaw House prized learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members.[6] Thus, many Ravenclaws tended to be academically motivated and talented students. They also prided themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods. It was not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun.[7] Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered placing her in Ravenclaw. Ravenclaws tended to be curious about the world and paid attention to the world around them. Ravenclaws were known to be logical and rational. In addition, Ravenclaw students tended to have abilities regarding Memory. Garrick Ollivander, for example, possessed an eidetic memory and can remember every wand he has sold,[21] and Gilderoy Lockhart had an exceptional talent in the Memory Charm.</p>

		<h2>Founder: <span>Godric Gryffindor</span></h2>
		<p>Godric Gryffindor was a wizard and one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was great friends with Salazar Slytherin but opposed him when he later thought that they should not accept Muggle-born students at Hogwarts. It is unknown when he died. Gryffindor's birthplace became known as Godric's Hollow, in his honour. Godric Gryffindor's portrait still remains at Hogwarts. Godric Gryffindor valued courage, determination, chivalry, and strength of heart, and was described as one of the four most brilliant witches and wizards of his time. Said to be one of "the four most brilliant witches and wizards of the time",[3] Godric Gryffindor founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his adulthood, with friends Salazar Slytherin, Helga Hufflepuff, and Rowena Ravenclaw, though he later severed ties with Slytherin. He even appeared to have carefully selected members of his own House.</p>
